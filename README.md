## Weights used in paper
####### It is highly recommended that individuals that want to recreate the findings from this paper to generate the PRS weights using their own LD matrix created from the UKBB exome-seq data. Variants that are in Dhindsa that do not appear in the UKBB exome data (Bulk/Exome sequences/Population level exome OQFE variants, PLINK format - final release/) (Different Methods) are still contained within the PRS panels. These obviously do not go into the PRS calculations as they are not in the dataset.
